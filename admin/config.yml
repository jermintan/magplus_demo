# admin/config.yml

# This is the backend configuration. It tells Decap how to connect to your Git repo.
backend:
  name: github
  repo: jermintan/magplus_demo # IMPORTANT: Replace with your actual username and repo name
  branch: deploy-fix # Or master, whichever is your main branch

# This tells Decap where to upload images. It MUST match your Eleventy setup.

public_folder: "/public/images" # The public-facing path for the images

# Collections define the types of content that can be edited.
# We only have one for now: Products.
collections:
  - name: "products" # An identifier for the collection
    label: "Products" # The name that will appear in the CMS UI
    label_singular: "Product" # The name for a single item
    description: "Manage all product specifications here."
    folder: "_data/products_collection" # TEMPORARY - Decap works best with one file per item. We'll merge them later.
    create: true # Allow users to create new products
    delete: true # Allow users to delete products
    slug: "{{slug}}" # Use the 'slug' field for the filename
    fields: # These are the fields for each product. They MUST match your JSON structure.
